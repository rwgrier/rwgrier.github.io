Below are some of the apps that Iâ€™ve worked on that are still available. I have also worked on other apps, which are no longer available. Those apps include DS_Store Cleaner, MyCntUp, LearnIt, and MarkIt Up.

## MyCntdwn

MyCntdwn is the best countdown app on the iPhone.

MyCntdwn (short for My Countdown) is a simple application that allows you to set events in the future and then have an easy way to see how long is left before the event gets here. You can use it for events like vacations, weddings, holidays, etc. 

MyCntdwn is the perfect way to show the kids the number of days left until Christmas (or their birthday).
