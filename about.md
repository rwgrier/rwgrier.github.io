## About Me 

Hi there üëãüèª. This is my site. It's not much. But it's mine. 

I post here at seemiingly random times on various subjects. I've written about technical and personal subjects, video games, brewing beer, books, etc. I'm not great at writing, and I use this site/blog as a way to practice. 

I am a professional software engineer. I have a Master‚Äôs Degree in Software Engineering and have been programming professionally for over 20 years. Since 2010, I've been specializing in iOS. I still dable in other things, but iOS has been my focus. 

## About the site

This site is one of my pet projects. 

This site is served up using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 

I took a Jekyll theme ([Laynon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon)) that I liked and then customized it for my own needs. I ended up completely rewriting the theme using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It's not really a packagable theme anymore, but I know how the ins and outs now. 

The site is completely open-sourced and available for inspection. You can view the source on my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/rwgrier/rwgrier.github.io). 

I host the site on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I used to host on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), but I wanted a little more control over the site and how things were run. So I ended up moving to Netlify in early 2021. 

## Social 

You can follow me or contact me on any of these social networks. I'm not super active on any of them. But occassionally I'll post things there.
