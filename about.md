## About Me 

Hello there üëãüèª. This is my site. It's not much. But it's mine. 

I post here at seemingly random times on various subjects. I've written about technical and personal subjects, video games, brewing beer, books, etc. I'm not great at writing, and I use this site/blog as a way to practice. 

I am a professional software engineer. Furthermore, I have a Master‚Äôs Degree in Software Engineering and have been programming professionally for over 20 years. 

I started out as a Java developer writing J2EE services for companies like Siemens and Comcast.  

Since 2010, I‚Äôve been writing mobile apps for NAVTEQ (Nokia), Barclaycard US, Comcast Interactive Media and Warner Bros. Digital Labs. I‚Äôve led high-profile iOS projects for both Comcast and Warner Bros. Digital Labs including Xfinity Home, DC Universe and Boomerang. The iOS App Store has featured both DC Universe and Boomerang multiple times. 

I am a highly motived engineer. I learned iOS development on my own. I am still continuing to learn every day. I run multiple side projects so that I can continue to learn both mobile and server-side technologies. 

I'm currently specializing in iOS. I still dabble in other things, but iOS has been my focus. 

## About the site

This site is one of my pet projects. 

This site is served up using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 

I took a Jekyll theme ([Laynon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon)) that I liked and then customized it for my own needs. I ended up completely rewriting the theme using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It's not really a packagable theme anymore, but I know how the ins and outs now. 

The site is completely open-sourced and available for inspection. You can view the source on my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/rwgrier/rwgrier.github.io). 

I host the site on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I used to host on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), but I wanted a little more control over the site and how things were run. So I ended up moving to Netlify in early 2021. 

## Social
