I am a software engineer who loves the challenges involved in software engineering. I started out as a Java developer and switched to mobile development (full time) a few years ago. I learned both iOS and Android on my own and in my free time.

I spent the first 10 years of my career writing J2EE services for companies like Siemens and Comcast. Since 2010 Iâ€™ve been writing mobile apps for NAVTEQ (Nokia), Barclaycard US and Comcast Interactive Media.
