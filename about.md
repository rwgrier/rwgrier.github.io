I am a software engineer who loves solving challenging problems. I started as a Java developer and transitioned to mobile development in 2010. 

I am a highly motivated developer. I initially learned iOS on my own. Since then I've grown as a developer and have worked on and led projects that have been featured on the App Store multiple times. â€¨
