I am a professional software engineer who loves a challenge. I have a Master’s Degree in Software Engineering and have been programming professionally for over 20 years.

I started out as a Java developer writing J2EE services for companies like Siemens and Comcast.  

Since 2012, I’ve been writing mobile apps for NAVTEQ (Nokia), Barclaycard US, Comcast Interactive Media and Warner Bros. Digital Labs. I’ve led high-profile iOS projects for both Comcast and Warner Bros. Digital Labs including Xfinity Home, DC Universe and Boomerang. The iOS App Store has featured both DC Universe and Boomerang multiple times. 

I am a highly motived engineer. I learned iOS development on my own. I am still continuing to learn every day. I run multiple side projects so that I can continue to learn both mobile and server-side technologies.
