Request to the Internet Archive and the Wayback Machine:

I am the owner of the sites: 

https://www.ryangrier.com
https://ryan.grier.co 


Can I please have these sites removed from the Internet Wayback Machine? Records for ryangrier.com go back as early as 2001. Records for grier.co go back as early as 2014. 

I do not wish to have these snapshots in time recorded on the Internet Wayback Machine and archive.org. 

I would also like to no longer have these sites crawled for new snapshots.
