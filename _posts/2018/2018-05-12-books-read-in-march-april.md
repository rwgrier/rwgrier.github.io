I missed posting the books I read in March and am really late in posting about April. It’s pretty bad that it’s only May and I’m already slacking on my commitment to myself to be open about the books I’m reading this year. I hope this was just a blip. 

Books for March and April are:
- [Shattered Empire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25113095-shattered-empire)
- [Obi-Wan & Anakin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28016727-obi-wan-anakin)
- [Canto Bight](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35798468-canto-bight)

I read a lot of comics books (graphic novels). I also went a bit heavy on the Star Wars stuff again. 

I _finally_ read through the Marvel Civil War graphic novel. I’ve been meaning to read through that for years. I finally got around to it. It was good. Not as good as other storylines, but still good. 

## Slower on Kindle
I’ve been reading on my Kindle a little slower than expected. This  started right around the time I decided to read a technical book on it.

I can’t do this. I am a much slower reader when it comes to technical books. I also won’t read technical books before bed. I prefer fiction just before going to bed. 

I finished the technical book last night. I think I need to stick with fiction on my Kindle and use my iPad to read technical books. I’ll try this out and see how it works.  

## Got a Favorite?
I think the best comic book I read this month was Aphra. I hadn’t known much about her character in the Star Wars universe outside of the Darth Vader comics I read previously. She’s a pretty cool character and I’ve got Vol 2 in her story arc queued up and ready to go. I’m looking forward to reading more about her soon. 

As far as novels go, I really enjoyed both Shift and We Are Legion. 

Shift is the second in [Silo series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silo_(series)) by Hugh Howey. I absolutely loved the first in the series ([Wool](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13453029-wool-omnibus)) and loved this one too. I’ve got the third one, I just need to read through it. It’s an excellent series and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys post apocalyptic fiction. 

We Are Legion was great. I believe I got it on [Audible](https://www.audible.com) on sale. It’s the first of it’s own series ([Bobiverse](http://bobiverse.wikia.com/wiki/We_Are_Legion_(We_Are_Bob)_Wiki)). I wasn’t expecting to like it as much as I did. I can’t wait to read the next in the series. It’s already on my wishlist. 

## What’s Next? 
I’m already a few books into the May list. I’m trying to read a few more technical books. These take me much longer to read. Not sure if it’s the authors I’m reading, or I’m trying harder to retain the content I’m reading. 

I think I’ll be trying to go forward with reading four books at a time. One comic book, one audio book, one technical book and one novel on my Kindle. It’s a lot to track and I’m not sure how well I’ll be able to track the various books. But I’m going to try it out. it’s probably the only way I’ll be able to read technical books.
