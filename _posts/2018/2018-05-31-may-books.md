Look at me! I’m getting this post out _before_ the end of the month. Sure, it’s the last day of the month. But that’s better than a month or two late, right? Right?

May was a pretty light reading month. I still managed to read 5 books. And one of them was a technical book, which always takes me longer. I’ve started on a 6th (technical) book, but haven’t finished it yet. That’ll be tracked next month. 

Here are the books I managed to tackle:

- [Fetching Raymond: A Ford County Story](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18014776-fetching-raymond)
- [Last Shot: A Han and Lando Novel](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38602136-last-shot)
- [Functional Swift: Updated for Swift 4](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28215949-functional-swift)
- [Justice League, Volume 1: Origin](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13227852-justice-league-volume-1)
- [Darth Plagueis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11099729-darth-plagueis)

Only one comic book this month. For some reason, I thought I had read more than that. Interesting. I wonder if I missed some in my [GoodReads account](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19943569-ryan-grier). 

## What’s your favorite? 
None… They were all just meh…

This may be one of the months where I didn’t have a clear favorite. They were all just OK. I really thought I would enjoy Darth Plaguis and I guess if pressed to pick a favorite, that would be it. But they were just OK.
