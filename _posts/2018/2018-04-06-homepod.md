I had mentioned in a [previous post](https://ryan.grier.co/2018/01/19/alexa-vs-google/) that we’ve been playing with personal assistants like Google Home and Alexa. I also mentioned that I would probably be getting a [HomePod](https://www.apple.com/homepod/). 

I got one. About a month ago. 

I really like HomePod. However, my use case for the HomePod is different than the Google Home products. I use it in my home office as a speaker. All I really ask it to do is play music and it sounds great. 

I should probably ask Siri (HomePod) to do things other than play certain music. You know, for science. But I just haven’t yet. 

My one gripe with having so many Siri devices in a small area is that whenever I would say “Hey Siri …” multiple devices would light up. Sometimes my Apple Watch or iPhone would respond. I fixed the issue (I think) by turning off the “Listen for Her Siri” option in settings (Settings \> Siri & Search). It’s been working much better since then. 

So far, I’m loving HomePod. It makes a great speaker for my office.
