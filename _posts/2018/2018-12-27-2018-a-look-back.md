2018 was a very busy, but very satisfying year. We bought a [new house](https://ryan.grier.co/2018/10/23/new-house/), bought a new car, went to Italy, [shipped a huge app](https://ryan.grier.co/2018/10/17/dc-universe/) and had a lot of good times. There were a lot more successes and failures that I just never wrote about. Maybe I’ll write about them sometime, but I just haven’t gotten around to it. 

## 2018 goals, how’d I do?
Before I looked back at my [2018 goals](https://ryan.grier.co/2018/01/05/2017-recap-and-2018-goals/), I thought I did a really good job toward my goals. Turns out, not so much. I’ve only accomplished one of my goals successfully. Ouch. I really thought I did a better job. 

### Run a 5k (or two) 
Nope. Didn’t happen. I walked a _lot_ this year, but didn’t do a lot of running. It’s still on my wishlist. I just need to commit and make the time to do it. 

### Read 20 books
That happened. In 2018, I [finished 63 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/10337127). There were a bunch of comic books in there, but I still totally count them. 

My Kindle Paperwhite helped out enormously with this. It makes reading in bed, when I can’t sleep, so much easier. I also take it with me whenever I travel anywhere and read. 

I’ve also continued my (almost) daily habit of walking 1-3 times a day. During these walks, I will always listen to either an audiobook or podcast. Lately, I’ve been leaning more towards books, but that’ll swing back to podcasts at some point. 

These two things (Kindle Paperwhite and walking with audiobooks) have helped me reach this goal. 

### More blog posts
I’d like to say that I did this, but I don’t think I can count it as completed. I did write more blog posts in 2018 than in 2017, but not enough. I was hoping to write a blog post every two weeks. This definitely did not happen. I wrote in spurts. But I also had long lulls of inactivity. 

### Present something (again)
Nope. I presented things at work to a small group of developers. But nothing to the community at large. I was hoping to present something to our [local CocoaHeads chapter](http://phillycocoa.org). 

Frankly. I forgot that this was a goal of mine. I suck. 

## So… now what?
I’m not sure it makes sense to try making goals for an entire year. I think in 2019, I’m going to try things on a monthly basis. 

Trying to make goals for the entire year end up with two issues. 1: I end up forgetting my goals. 2: I can’t adjust when I’m going way off the rails. 

Hey, who knows. Maybe monthly goals will work out. Or maybe I’ll do as good a job with them as I did with my 2018 goals. I guess we’ll find out.
