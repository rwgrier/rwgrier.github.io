As a developer, there are a handful of tools that I use (almost) every day. I thought I would write a blog post about them. 

This post is about my the applications that I use every day for development. It doesn’t really get into my office/desk setup or some of my favorite applications. Only what I use on a day to day basis in order to get my job (as an iOS/tvOS developer) done. 

Maybe in a future post, I’ll go more into my office/desk setup. I’ll save that for another time. 

## Xcode
Xcode is my primary development tool. It’s an [Integrated Development Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) (IDE). Its got everything I need including a source editor, interface builder, compiler, profiling tools and much more. 

I both love and hate Xcode on a daily basis. 

Xcode has gotten much better over the years. It still has it’s moments. On most days, I really appreciate it and what it gives me as a developer. 

There is at least one alternative to Xcode. [AppCode](http://www.jetbrains.com/objc/) has been around a while. I’ve tried it before and even purchased a license a few years ago. I’ve just never been able to fully commit to AppCode. I don’t know why, but I haven’t. I’ve stuck with Xcode instead. 

[Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) is available on the Mac App Store for free. 

## Charles Proxy 
Charles Proxy is an HTTP proxy/monitor application. It allows you to monitor web traffic from a variety of sources, including macOS/iOS/tvOS devices and the iOS/tvOS simulator.

Charles Proxy is a great tool. I don’t use it every day. I do use it 3-4 times a week. I like Charles Proxy so much that I’ve written about it before. Not just [once](https://ryan.grier.co/2016/09/28/setting-up-charles-proxy-on-apple-tv-tvos/), but [twice](https://ryan.grier.co/2017/03/17/charles-proxy-primer/). 

I use Charles Proxy to look at the web data coming into the apps I develop over the network. I’m usually looking for a few things. 

Firstly, I need to see what that data looks like coming across the Internet into the apps that I write. I need to know what it looks like so that I can use that data properly within the app. 

Secondly, when there are issues with our apps, I like to make sure the data we’re getting from the services we use are what we’re expecting and seeing in the app. 

[Charles Proxy](https://www.charlesproxy.com) is available through their site for $50 (USD).

## Tower
Tower is a source control client for [Git](https://git-scm.com). We use Git (through GitHub) at work and I use [GitHub](https://github.com) and [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org) for my personal projects. Tower is a great tool for both of these sources. 

I used to use [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com), but a change in the app about a year ago lead me to look for another tool. I don’t even remember what the change was, I just knew it was time for a change. I asked on Twitter for suggestions, and Tower was the overwhelming response. 

During the writing of this post, I was describing how I wish Tower could squash commits. [GitUp](http://gitup.co) was one of the tools I tried while looking for a new Git client and it allows commits to be squashed. Turns out, Tower will allow you to squash commits. The instructions on how to do this is [here](https://www.git-tower.com/help/mac/commit-history/interactive-rebase). It’s not super intuitive, but I’m glad I’ve figured out how to do it. 

[Tower](https://www.git-tower.com) is available through their site for $69 (USD) a year. 

## Dash (with Alfred integration)
[Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) is the perfect document browser. I use it constantly throughout the day for iOS and tvOS documentation. But it’s not limited to iOS/tvOS documentation. You can download documentation for almost any language or tool that you can think of. 

Dash is perfect with [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com). Alfred is an application launcher, but it’s so much more. If you purchase the [Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/), you can set up (or install) more  complicated workflows. One of these workflows I have is to [launch Dash](https://www.alfredapp.com/blog/productivity/dash-quicker-api-documentation-search/) and search for terms I’m looking for. So, I will trigger Alfred (option + space) and then type `dash {search term}` and Dash will be launched and search for what I’m looking for. This doesn’t seem like a big deal, but it saves me a few steps dozens of times a day. 

[Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) is available through their site for $29.99 (USD)
[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) is available through their site for free. 
The [Alfred Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/) is available through the site for £19 (GBP). 

## Bear
[Bear](http://www.bear-writer.com) is a note taking app. I’ve got notes for everything in that app. I track my 1:1 meeting notes with managers and other folks. I track general conversations. I’ve got outlines on application and component designs in there.  I’ve even got video game notes in there. 

I could just use the built in Notes app, but Bear is much nicer. I love the built in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) support.  I use Markdown for just about everything (documentation-wise). Bear supporting Markdown has made it my go-to note-taking app. 

I have just started tinkering with [Agenda](https://www.agenda.com), which is a different note taking app. I haven’t used it enough to make a decision one way or the other. 

[Bear](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear-beautiful-writing-app/id1091189122?ls=1&mt=12) is available on the Mac App Store for $14.99 (USD) a year. 

## Honorable Mentions
Here are some development apps that I love, but don’t use every day, or even on a weekly basis. They are great apps and I thought I would mention them. 

## BBEdit
[BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) is a text editor. It’s a super simple, but (almost) perfect text editor. I’ve been using it forever. I think I got my first version of BBEdit in the late 90s. The first version I got came in a box and I’ve been using it ever since. 

I learned how to write code in BBEdit. Sure, it was HTML, Javascript and CSS, but it started me down the path to where I am now. 

BBEdit is perfect for editing single (or multiple) source files in a large variety of languages. I’ve used it for everything from HTML, to CSS, too Ruby, to Java, to Swift and Objective-C. 

I don’t use BBEdit every day, but I do use it a lot. It almost made it onto the non-honorable mention list, but I left it off since I may only use it every other week. It will always have a special place in my heart. 

[BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) is available through their site for $49.99 (USD)

### Paw
[Paw](https://paw.cloud) is an HTTP client app. It can make HTTP requests to APIs and display the results to you in a variety of ways. This is a network tool, like Charles Proxy, but is used differently. This tool is to send requests to an API and inspect the results. 

I use Paw a lot when I’m being introduced to a new API. I use it when I need to learn how call an API and what to expect from that API. 

I will use Paw heavily when learning a new API, but once I’ve learned how that API works, I won’t use Paw as much. 

[Paw](https://paw.cloud) is available through their site for $49.99 (USD)

## Soulver
[Soulver](https://www.acqualia.com/soulver/) is a fancy calculator. That simplifies things a bit. But I use it as a calculator/scratchpad. Instead of writing down numbers and doing calculations on paper, I use Soulver. I have a bunch of “scratchpads” in my iCloud account for a variety of different things. 

[Soulver](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/soulver/id413965349?mt=12) is available on the Mac App Store for $11.99 (USD). 

## Supporting Developers
A lot of the apps I use have free alternatives. But I am a big believer in supporting app developers who do quality work. I use more apps than I have listed here, but these are my daily development apps. 

In future blog posts, I may also go into my office/desk setup and other non-work related apps I use day to day.
