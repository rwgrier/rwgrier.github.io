It’s been a while since I’ve posted anything other than lists of books I’ve been reading here. So I thought I would post something slightly different.

I posted about my gaming habits most recently in [November of last year](https://ryan.grier.co/2017/11/05/video-games-and-gaming/). Since then, not a lot has changed. I still play quite a bit of [Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes](https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/galaxy-of-heroes). I’ve played less and less of [Hearthstone](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/), but I think I’m going to pick it up again. 

Mobile gaming is just so accessible to me. My phone is always with me. 

Since November, I’ve been slowly (and I mean slowly) making my way through [The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild](https://www.zelda.com/breath-of-the-wild/). I’ve managed to get through two of the Divine Beasts (Divine Beast Vah Ruta & Divine Beast Vah Rudania). I’ve still got quite a ways to go to finish the game. I suspect that it’ll take me six more months to do so. 

Other than that, I haven’t done much gaming at all. I was thinking of a list of games I’d love to get (back) to. Here are some of them. 

- [Fallout 4](https://fallout.bethesda.net)
- [Skyrim](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en?)
- [Guild Wars 2](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/) (the Path of Fire expansion)
- [World of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/) (Warlords of Draenor - I’m way behind)
- [Destiny 2](https://www.destinythegame.com)
- [Forza Horizon 3](https://forzamotorsport.net/en-US/games/fh3)
- [Super Mario Odyssey](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/super-mario-odyssey-switch)
- [Metroid: Samus Returns](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/metroid-samus-returns-3ds)

And so many more!

There are so many good games out there. I just wish I had the time to play more. I used to finish a game every other week or so. Now, I’m lucky if I can play a console game once a week. I’m not saying I wish that would change. What’s occupied my time is my family. I just wish there was more time… But then I think we all wished that too.
