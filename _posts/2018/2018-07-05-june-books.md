Just when I thought I was doing well with reading, it all went wrong. June was a rough month. It should have been a great one for reading, but it just wasn’t. 

The only thing I read in June were comic books. I finished three of them. They are:

- [Mace Windu](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35605160-mace-windu)
- [The Force Awakens](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29775749-the-force-awakens)
- [Han Solo](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30621521-han-solo)

The first week in June, I went to Apple’s WWDC conference in San Jose. I was traveling and did read a little bit while on the plane. But really, I spent most of my time while not conferencing watching movies on my iPad. 

At the end of the month, I went on vacation with my family. I forgot my Kindle. Bad move on my part. I could have read on my phone, but the experience is so much nicer on the kindle. I got lazy and just hung out instead.

This mess of a month in reading means that I have a bunch of books that I am currently reading. I am in the middle of seven books. Seven books… I know, right? What was I thinking?!?! I have two paperbacks, a Kindle book, Apple Books book, a comic book, an audio book and a technical book that I’m currently reading. I’ve been able to keep them all straight. I need to start finishing these. 

July should be a good month for finishing books. I’m reading all of these books at the same time. And I’m at least 50% through them all. I just need to start finishing them.
