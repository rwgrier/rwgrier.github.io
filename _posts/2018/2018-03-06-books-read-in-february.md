Here are a list of books that I’ve read in February. I’m still going strong and reading plenty of books. My goal for the year was 20 and I’ve already read 17 books. If I keep this up, I’ll pass the goal next month. 

This has already beaten last year’s count. Last year’s goal was 12 and I managed 14. 

One a sidenote, I missed a book in my January list. I had finished [Phasma](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34859132-phasma) late in the month and forgot to record it. 

February’s books are:

- [The Lincoln Lawyer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79885.The_Lincoln_Lawyer) 
- [First Blood](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27415713-first-blood)
- [The Great Train Robbery](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7682.The_Great_Train_Robbery)
- [Captain Phasma](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35009797-captain-phasma)
- [The Girl Who Takes an Eye for an Eye](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32599492-the-girl-who-takes-an-eye-for-an-eye)
- [Anansi Boys](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2744.Anansi_Boys)

## Fewer books this month
There are fewer books on this month’s list. The reason for that is that I didn’t read any short stories/novellas that I thought were full length books. There’s nothing wrong with short stories and novellas, but they inflated my numbers a bit. 

## Wider variety this month too
I’ve read a wider variety of books this month. That mostly means less Star Wars content.  I still read through two Star Wars comics. They were both excellent. But I’ve been reading more of what I typically read. 

## What are you reading now?
I still have three books going at a time. It’s still a Kindle book, audiobook and comic. I think that’s a good balance. I often listen to audiobooks on my walks. And I read comics and kindle books at other times of the day. 

The comic I’m currently reading is [Shattered Empire](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25113095-shattered-empire). So far it’s really good. I’m almost done with it and should finish it this weekend. 

I’m reading [Shift](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17306293-shift) on my kindle. I had read through [Wool Omnibus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13453029-wool-omnibus) last Summer and really enjoyed it. This is the second novel in that series (which is actually a prequel). 

Lastly, I’m currently listening to [Artemis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34928122-artemis). If you enjoyed [The Martian](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18007564-the-martian), I think you’ll like this one too. I’m not finished with it yet, but I really enjoy Andy Weir’s writing style. 

## Most/Least favorites of the month? 
My favorite book this month was either Anansi Boys or The Girl Who Takes an Eye for an Eye. 

I’ve only read one book by Neil Gaiman before ([American Gods](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30165203-american-gods)). I really enjoyed that book and liked this one too. Apparently both are in the same series/universe?. I like Neil Gaiman’s style of writing. I’m not sure why I haven’t read more of his work. 

The Girl Who Takes an Eye for an Eye is the 5th in that series. I’ve liked that series from the beginning. I know the author has changed since the beginning, but I still like the series. 

My least favorite book this month was The Lincoln Lawyer. After reading the book, I discovered that I had read this book before. It must have left one heck of an impression that I didn’t remember reading it. Oh well. 

I’ve been happy that I’ve been sticking with reading this much so far. I was afraid that it would drop off after the first month.
