I did a little better job of reading in July than I did in [June](https://ryan.grier.co/2018/07/05/june-books/). I had a few books that I was determined to finish. At the start of the month, I had too many books that were in progress. Iâ€™ve finished a few, but I think I still have too many books that are in progress. Iâ€™m still trying to finish those before I start any new books. 

## What books are in progress?
Iâ€™ve got three books that Iâ€™ve been reading for over a few months. I really want to finish these before picking up a new book. 

### Doctor Sleep by Stephen King
Iâ€™ve been reading [Doctor Sleep](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16130549-doctor-sleep) for a long time. A few years in fact. Itâ€™s been great so far. Oddly enough, I remember whatâ€™s happening in the story. 

This was a paperback book that I bought a while ago and left in the car to read during my sonâ€™s soccer practices. Iâ€™d read for an hour or so and then leave the book in the car until the next practice. Whenever my wife or daughter came along I didnâ€™t read the book. Likewise, if I just dropped him off and ran home (or errands), I wouldnâ€™t read it either. There were also other times, when I would read a different book. 

This book is still sitting in my car. ðŸ¤£ Needless to say, I need (and want) to finish this book. 

### Server-Side Swift (Vapor Edition) by Paul Hudson
I started reading [Server-Side Swift (Vapor Edition)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39008989-server-side-swift) a few months ago before Summer started. I made some amazing progress in a few days. Since then Iâ€™ve slacked off quite a bit. 

I canâ€™t just read this book. The book is a series of projects that you need to work through with a computer. So I typically setup the book on my iPad and work through the examples one by one. 

Iâ€™ve learned quite a bit about server-side Swift so far. Iâ€™m about halfway through the book. I have finally been able to get back to the book. I should be able to work through the rest of the book in the next few weeks. 

### Becoming Steve Jobs by Brent Schlender & Rick Tetzeli
Iâ€™ve also been reading [Becoming Steve Jobs](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22318382-becoming-steve-jobs) for a long time. I got this book on the [Apple iBooks Store](https://www.apple.com/ibooks/). I had been reading it slowly at night on my phone. When Iâ€™m reading in bed, I usually opt for fiction instead. Reading non-fiction has never been my strong suit, I typically read it much slower than fiction. 

Normally, when I read fiction, I prefer listening to an audio version. Itâ€™s just easier for me to consume. Iâ€™m not sure why, but it is. 

Iâ€™ll finish this book. I like it so far. Itâ€™s just taking me longer than I want to. 

## What has been finished? 
I read quite a bit actually. Not as much as some previous months. But certainly more than I read in June. 

- [Skywalker Strikes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24718416-skywalker-strikes)
- [Showdown on the Smuggler's Moon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25861677-showdown-on-the-smuggler-s-moon)
- [Armada](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16278318-armada)
- [Gone Girl](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19288043-gone-girl)
- [Tom Clancy Point of Contact](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40730651-tom-clancy-point-of-contact)
- [Natural Disaster: I Cover Them. I am One.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35099655-natural-disaster)
- [Star Wars: Doctor Aphra, Vol. 2: The Enormous Profit](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35605140-star-wars)

A few of those books were hanging over my head from the pervious month. Armada, Gone Girl and Point of Contact. I had started them all in June and only finished them last month. 

There are also a few comic books on there. What can I say, I like reading them.

## Got a favorite?
I think I enjoyed Gone Girl the most. Even though the story was spoiled early for me, I still enjoyed it. 

Armada was a disappointment for me. Ernest Clineâ€™s first book ([Ready Player One](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9969571-ready-player-one)) was just so good. I was expecting the same thing from this one. But when Iâ€™ve talked to other people, they were also disappointed in Armada. It was still a good book, but just not as good as Ready Player One. 

Not the best month Iâ€™ve had reading, but better than others. At least Iâ€™m reading. That was one of my goals for the year.
