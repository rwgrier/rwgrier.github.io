Around the holidays, our family has a list of movies that we like to watch. It’s a tradition that we’ve tried to keep for a few years now. It’s not always easy, but it’s one of the things we can all usually agree on. 

Some of our favorite movies are: 
- [Elf](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/elf-2003/id287917512)
- [National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/national-lampoons-christmas-vacation/id296929739)
- [Home Alone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/home-alone/id344796733)
- [How the Grinch Stole Christmas](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/how-the-grinch-stole-christmas-the-ultimate-edition/id1428414879)
- [Die Hard](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/die-hard/id270711082)

This year I’ve added [A Christmas Story](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/a-christmas-story/id297444171) to the list to watch. I used to watch this movie all of the time growing up. I found it hard to imagine that no one else has even seen the movie. I hope to fix that problem this year. 

This year, we haven’t started watching any. I feel like we’re really behind. The kids have been so busy that it makes it hard to sit down and do things as a family. I hope we’re OK. We still have about two weeks left to watch everything. 

My favorites on this list are either National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation or Die Hard. I love these movies. Elf is another good one. But Christmas Vacation makes me laugh so hard. Die Hard is just a good movie to watch from time to time. 

I’m looking forward to seeing these movies this year.
