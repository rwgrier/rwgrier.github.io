My latest release of [Beer Style Guidelines](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/beer-styles-bjcp-2015/id998139111?ls=1) has just gone out.

This version of Beer Style Guidelines (finally) includes a new beer style guideline. I’ve just added the [Brewers Association 2020 Beer Style Guidelines](https://www.brewersassociation.org/edu/brewers-association-beer-style-guidelines/). This is the first guide update I’ve done since the 2017 version of this same guide. 

The other (included) guides from the Brewers Association are so old (2016 & 2017), I’ve removed them from the app. I’m not aware of many people who like to compare the guidelines from year to year. To me, it only makes sense to have the latest version included in the app. 

I’ve also fixed a few bugs within the app. But the largest change is the new guide being added.
