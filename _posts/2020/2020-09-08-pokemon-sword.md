This past weekend, I finished [Pokémon Sword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokémon_Sword_and_Shield). It was a good game. I bought the game at launch and haven’t really gotten into it until a few weeks ago. 

The storyline was interesting and being able to take another Pokémon trainer from nothing to champion is always fun. Plus collecting all of those Pokémon along the way is a nice challenge.  I’m glad that I finally played through the game. If you’ve played a Pokémon game before, you’ve got the general idea of what this game is about. 

I have purchased both of the DLC expansion packs ([The Isle of Armor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokémon_Sword_and_Shield:_The_Isle_of_Armor) & [The Crown Tundra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokémon_Sword_and_Shield:_The_Crown_Tundra)). The Isle of Armor is out now, but I haven’t started the content yet. The Crown Tundra doesn’t come out until later this year.  

The game has had quite a bit of [backlash](https://kotaku.com/why-pokemon-fans-are-so-mad-about-sword-and-shield-1836226219) against it because the developers did not include all of the prior Pokémon in the game (like other games have done). This wasn't a huge issue for me. I’ve only ever tried to complete a Pokédex once and it just wasn’t worth it to me. It would be nice for them to have included all of the prior Pokémon, only so that I can transfer them to the game from Pokémon [Home](https://home.pokemon.com/en-us/)/[Bank](https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-video-games/pokemon-bank/).

I’m relatively new to Pokemon games. I’ve only been playing them the last few years. I’m not some diehard fan who’s been playing since the first game. I do enjoy playing them. Besides this game, other Pokémon games I’ve played through include: [Pokémon Black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokémon_Black_and_White), [Pokémon Black 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokémon_Black_2_and_White_2), [Pokémon X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokémon_X_and_Y), and [Pokémon Alpha Sapphire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokémon_Omega_Ruby_and_Alpha_Sapphire). It’s really not a lot. 

I skipped both [Pokémon Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokémon_Sun_and_Moon) and [Pokémon Ultra Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokémon_Ultra_Sun_and_Ultra_Moon). I own them both, but for some reason, I never played through them. I do need to go back and play them. I think I need a short break from Pokémon games before I do so. 

I’m not sure if I’ll play the first Pokémon Sword expansion or Moon/Ultra Moon next. Like I said, I think I need a short break before diving back in.
