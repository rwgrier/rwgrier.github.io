Over a year ago, I [removed MyCntdwn from the App Store](https://ryan.grier.co/2019/10/22/sad-day/). But I’m not sure that’s the end of the story for MyCntdwn.  

I’ve been working on an update to MyCntdwn for a long time now. I’ve had multiple starts and stops. This _could_ just be another false start in the lifecycle of MyCntdwn. I'm not really sure just yet. 

## Why am I doing this? 

Working on MyCntdwn is a mechanism for learning new things. In my normal [day job](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rwgrier/), I don’t usually get to play with the latest and greatest technologies. The apps I’m working on currently support iOS 12+. We do get some time set aside to learn new tech, but we rarely ever get to apply it. This gives me the chance to do that. 

I’ve started this latest iteration/update of MyCntdwn with a brand new Xcode project. I started from scratch. Nothing has transferred directly over. I’ve been using old code as a reference, but nothing has been directly copied over. 

I’ve been using a lot of things I just can’t use in my day job. [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/), [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine), [CloudKit](https://developer.apple.com/icloud/cloudkit/) (cloud sync, finally!), etc. The learning curve for these technologies has been steep, but it’s exactly what I have been looking for. This has given me a chance to learn new technologies, and apply them in a real-world app. 

The template that I chose for this project may allow me to release a native macOS app too. Not [Catalyst](https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/), but built with native SwiftUI code. I haven’t actually tried this yet, I’ve been focused on the iOS experience, but I plan to at some point. 

I may even try to include one or more widgets for the app using [WidgetKit](https://developer.apple.com/widgets/). 

## Why am I doing this with MyCntdwn? 

I’m not really sure. I have had other app ideas, but nothing has really taken root in my brain. MyCntdwn was my first (shipping) app in the App Store (shortly after the App Store launched) and continues to be my baby (app-wise). 

MyCntdwn also gives me a comfortable app to play in. I know how it should work. I know the feature list. I’m not trying to solidify a new idea while also learn new technologies. So far, It’s been working out nicely. 

## What’s next?
I’m just going to keep at it. Learning new things and applying them to MyCntdwn. I’m not sure if these changes will ever go anywhere. But I’ve had a lot of fun learning. Who knows, I may even be able to use them in my day job in a year or two. 

Or I may get distracted with video games (currently playing [The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-between-worlds-3ds/) again) and abandon this entirely.
