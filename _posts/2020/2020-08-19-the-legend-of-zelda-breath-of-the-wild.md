[The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Breath_of_the_Wild) was _the_ game to get when the [Nintendo Switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch) launched. It was the first game I bought when I got my Switch. People love this game. It appears on so many "best games on Switch" lists that I see online. 

I've said [this before](https://twitter.com/rwgrier/status/1265435231240302592?s=20), and I'll say it again. I just don't like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I've tried playing it on three separate occasions. Each time, I've tried and failed to get into it.

This (above) was as far as I got in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

I've gotten as far as freeing two of the four [Divine Beasts](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Divine_Beast). But I've never gotten further. Something just stops me from continuing it. I think my main problem with Breath of the Wild is that the weapons can break. I don't like the idea of breaking my favorite weapon(s) and not having a backup, or any weapon at all. I don't know why this bothers me so much. Probably because it's just such a departure from other Zelda games. But I hate this mechanic where weapons can break.

There are parts of the games that I really enjoy. The world is huge and you can explore anywhere. The differing temperatures throughout the world are a neat addition. The crafting was also interesting. The puzzles and dungeons are fantastic. 

It's not that I don't like [The Legend of Zelda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda) games. I recently played through [The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Link%27s_Awakening_(2019_video_game)) on the Switch and absolutely loved it. In fact, I enjoy most of the The Legend of Zelda games available. I wish they would remake more of them for the Switch, like they remade Link's Awakening. 

I've got so many other games that I want to play, that I just can't justify spending any more time on it. Life is too short to play games you don't like. 

Currently I am playing through both [Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Jedi:_Fallen_Order) & [Pokémon Sword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokémon_Sword_and_Shield). They are both a lot of fun in different ways. I'll have to write about them once I've finished them.
