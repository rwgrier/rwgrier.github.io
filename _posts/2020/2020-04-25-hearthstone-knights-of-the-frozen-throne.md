This is another post about Hearthstone and beating another Solo Adventure. I’ve done these sort of posts before for various solo adventures ([One Night in Karazhan](https://ryan.grier.co/2016/10/21/hearthstone-one-night-in-karazhan-heroic/), [Blackrock Mountain](https://ryan.grier.co/2016/04/24/hearthstone-blackrock-mountain-heroic/), [The League of Explorers](https://ryan.grier.co/2016/04/22/hearthstone-the-league-of-explorers-heroic/) & [Curse of Naxxramas](https://ryan.grier.co/2016/04/03/hearthstone-curse-of-naxxramas-heroic/)). This isn’t the most recent adventure, I’m really behind on completing these. 

[Knights of the Frozen Throne](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Knights_of_the_Frozen_Throne) was a little different than other adventures. Instead of beating the entire adventure on Heroic, you need to beat the final boss (The Lich King) with every class in the game. 

It took me a while to find the right decks for all of these classes. All of the guides out there, are very outdated and I’m more of a netdecker (finding capable decks online) than able to create my own. Some of these decks may also be outdated now. I’ve been sitting on this list for about 3 months now.  I believe some of the cards in these decks have been [nerfed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_balance#Nerf) by [Blizzard](https://www.blizzard.com) since I used them. I’ve been generally lazy about blogging, otherwise I would have posted this sooner. 

My reward for beating this adventure is a [Prince Arthas](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Prince_Arthas) hero skin for the [Paladin](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Paladin) class (seen below).

Below are the decks that I used to beat the Lich King with each class in the game (except [Demon Hunter](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Demon_Hunter)). 

## The Lich King
- Druid: [Easy First Try Lich King Druid](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/917300-easy-first-try-lich-king-druid) (substituted Kel’Thuzad for Arfus, Sub Feral Rage for The Lich King)
- Hunter: [\[budget\] Rexxar vs. The Lich King](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/917988-budget-rexxar-vs-the-lich-king) (substituted Molten Giant for Arcane Shot)
- Mage: [The Lich King Echo Giants Mage Deck](https://www.icy-veins.com/hearthstone/the-lich-king-echo-giants-mage-deck)
- Paladin: [FTP Paladin - Lich King Solo Mission](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1286704-ftp-paladin-lich-king-solo-mission)
- Priest: [Lich king (one shot)(Big Priest)](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/917277-lich-king-one-shot-big-priest)
- Rogue: [Standard\|Lich King\|Mecha'thun without Doomsayer...](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1311245-standard-lich-king-mechathun-without-doomsayer)
- Shaman: [Lich King Shaman Mecha'thun Deck](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1328963-lich-king-shaman-mechathun-deck)
- Warlock: [Lich King Warlock Mecha'thun Deck](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1328876-lich-king-warlock-mechathun-deck)
- Warrior: [Lich King - Warrior Mecha'thun Deck](https://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/1328798-lich-king-warrior-mechathun-deck)

I went through these classes in order above. You can see from this list (specifically near the bottom) where I started to lean heavily on the [Mecha'thun](https://www.hearthpwn.com/cards/89877-mechathun) card and mechanic. 

The Mecha’thun mechanic states that when this card dies “If you have no cards in your deck, hand, and battlefield, destroy the enemy hero.” This just means you need to burn through your cards, get Mecha’thun out onto the battlefield  and then kill him. If you can set it up, it’s a very easy win. 

There are a few more solo adventures available since The Lich King. They are mostly [dungeon run](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Dungeon_Run) style adventures. I think I am going to jump forward to take care of the latest adventure ([Galakrond's Awakening](https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Galakrond%27s_Awakening)) before going back to these. I’ve heard that the adventure is fairly easy to get through. I’m planning on going through that and documenting the decks I’ve used. 

Stay tuned…
