I’ve finally had a minute (or 60) to sit down and start watching videos from WWDC 2019. I know, I’m over a month late to the show.  

I watched both the [Keynote](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/101/) and [Platforms State of the Union](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/103/) on the first day of WWDC. But since then, I’ve been so busy with work and other stuff that I haven’t had much time to catch up. 

From the keynote and state of the union videos, I knew SwiftUI looked amazing. But I didn’t get a real sense of it until this week. 

I watched [Introducing SwiftUI: Building Your First App](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/204/). That was such a good video/session. I feel like I need to watch it again. I’m also looking forward to watching the other SwiftUI videos and learning much more about SwiftUI. 

I think Apple really nailed it with SwiftUI. It looks so simple and intuitive. I should be able to remove a lot of code in my personal apps (and eventually professional apps) because of SwiftUI. 

Tonight, I had a chance to sit down and start tinkering with SwiftUI. I currently feel like I’m lost in the woods with some things. It’s a bit overwhelming at first. There’s a lot going on that I don’t know how to do yet (interaction with Timers and Core Data). I need to watch more of Apple’s videos and really dig into the code a bit more. 

I’ve got plans to update both [MyCntdwn](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mycntdwn/id293970065?ls=1) and [Beer Style Guidelines](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/beer-style-guidelines/id998139111?ls=1) to use SwiftUI (among other new features). I’m really hoping that I get good chunks of time this Summer to really dive in and learn the new stuff. 

I just hope I have some time to actually make updates to my apps. Like for real this time. Things are so busy with the kids, that I rarely have much time to do this sort of thing anymore. 

But this Summer, I’m determined to watch many more videos from WWDC and incorporate new technologies into my apps.
