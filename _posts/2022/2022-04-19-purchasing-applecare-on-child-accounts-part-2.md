This is the second and final blog post about purchasing AppleCare+ on Child Accounts. [Part one](/2022/04/12/purchasing-applecare-on-child-accounts/) outlined the saga. I wanted to follow up in a post and mention how things turned out. 

I had rescheduled a call with my Apple Support contact for this previous Monday (April 18th). This call was also set for 8pm, like the last one. 

Leading up to this call, I had been checking Apple‚Äôs [Check Coverage](https://checkcoverage.apple.com) site every other day. I last checked on Easter Sunday. Each time with no luck. I figured I would pester the support person on what I should do. 

Monday at 8pm came and went. I waited for a call from Apple Support for about 30 minutes before giving up and figuring it was another no-show. Shortly after 9pm, I received a call from Apple. I missed the call because I was walking the dogs ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 

The support person left me a message saying that the issue was resolved. They went on to say that I should email them back and let them know if things were satisfactory on my end. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I check both kids‚Äô phones and the website and it appeared that the issue was indeed resolved. 

I am happy with the outcome, even though the process to get here wasn‚Äôt ideal. I‚Äôm not sure if purchasing AppleCare+ through a child account is an issue for everyone, or just us. I hope Apple has fixed the root cause of the issue. 

I‚Äôm glad this issue has been resolved. I‚Äòve spent _way_ too much time thinking about this and how to get it fixed.
