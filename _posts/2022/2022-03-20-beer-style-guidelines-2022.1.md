I released Beer Style Guidelines 2022.1 today. It's the first update of the year. 

The update includes the following:

 * Adds the [2021 BJCP Beer Style Guidelines](https://www.bjcp.org/bjcp-style-guidelines/).
 * Fixes a crashing issue. 
 * Removes access to the 2015 BJCP Beer Style Guidelines.
 * Removes access to the 2020 Brewers Association Beer Style Guidelines.
 * Adds basic [Telemetry](https://telemetrydeck.com) analytics.
 * Updates the "Page Down" keyboard shortcut to use a space (as it should have been all along).

The two big changes for me are the addition of the 2021 BJCP Beer Style Guidelines and fixing a crashing issue. 

I had missed that the [BJCP had released a new guideline](https://www.bjcp.org/news/bjcp-releases-2021-beer-style-guidelines/) at the end of December. It's the first update to the guidelines since 2015. I don't check all that often for new updates, but I should try to stay on top of things better. 

I also fixed a crashing issue. I'd seen a few reports of it in my weekly emails from Apple. I finally dove into it and got it fixed. 

I've already got the next update planned. The [Brewers Association](https://www.brewersassociation.org) has released their 2022 guidelines and I want to get that into the app as soon as possible. 

Once that's done, I have some other things in mind. I'm excited to get started on those once I've got all of the guidelines updated and current.
