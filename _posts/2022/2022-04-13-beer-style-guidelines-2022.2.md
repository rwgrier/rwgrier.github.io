Beer Style Guidelines 2022.2 has been released. 

I’m on a bit of a roll with these updates. In both of these updates, I’ve added new guides. 

This update includes the following:

 * Adds the [2022 Brewers Association Beer Style Guidelines](https://www.brewersassociation.org/edu/brewers-association-beer-style-guidelines/).
 * Fixes a crashing issue. For real this time. 🤞🏻

I had attempted to fix a crashing issue in the 2022.1 update. I don’t quite think that I got it that time. With the 2022.2 update, I feel much more confident that I was able to fix the crashing issue.

I have a few ideas on what I’m going to do next. None of the ideas are concrete though. I’ve thought about some new features to add to Beer Style Guidelines. I may also want to try working on a few new ideas that I’ve had. 

I’m not sure what I’ll work on next. For now, I think I’ll just sit back and have a 🍺.
