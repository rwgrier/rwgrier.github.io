A few weeks ago, we were looking for a new show to watch. We heard a lot of recommendations for [Yellowstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowstone_(American_TV_series)).

We watched it, binged it really. All 4 seasons.

The show was fine. Just fine. I can’t say that it was excellent, or terrible. The show fell somewhere in the middle for me. 

Yellowstone felt like a cross between [Succession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_(TV_series)) and [Sons of Anarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sons_of_Anarchy). We’ve only seen one season of Succession, but are planning on continuing with it. But we did watch 6 (SIX!) seasons of Sons of Anarchy before giving up (I did not like this show). Yellowstone felt like some weird crossover of these two shows. 

For me, the main saving grace of this show is Kevin Costner
and Jefferson White (as Jimmy). Most of the characters I either don’t like or am indifferent on. But I do like both Kevin Costner and Jefferson White’s characters.

Yellowstone is [returning for a 5th season](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/yellowstone-officially-returning-season-5-200000813.html). We’ll watch it, but it’s not one of my favorite shows.
