On our recent [trip to Florida](/2022/02/04/trip-to-florida/), we went to a few theme parks. We had planned on Universal Studios and Walt Disney World. 

I’m still not sure how we ended up at [Gatorland](https://www.gatorland.com) one afternoon, but we did. I think my daughter saw a billboard for it one day while driving from the soccer field back to our hotel.

We went with a few other families from the soccer team. 

Gatorland is a alligator themed park. They have more than just alligators, but gators are the main attraction. We also say crocodiles, tortoises, birds and a few big cats. 

The kids did the ropes course that they had there. While they did that, we explored more of the park.

We also had a chance to feed some gators. For the larger gators, they have dried food pellets (picture dry dog food for alligators). For the smaller gators (2-5 years), you can buy fish to put on a fishing line and feed them. We did both. The kids had a lot of fun feeding the fish the the younger gators. 

Gatorland was some place I never thought I would end up. It turned out to be a good time. I’m not sure I need to go back, but I’m glad I went.
