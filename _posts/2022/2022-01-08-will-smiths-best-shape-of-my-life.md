I recently finished watching Will Smith’s "[The Best Shape of My Life](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtb5OOwnB8RoCzJz57R0jrCUzYF6Yunw9)" 6-part docuseries on YouTube. 

It was really good. 

I went into the show thinking that it would all be about how Will Smith went from a COVID body back to the usual shape we’re used to seeing him in in his films.

It wasn’t. 

The docuseries wasn’t just about Will trying to lose weight and get back into shape. It was also about him writing his memoir and diving into his past. 

I learned a lot about Will Smith. I’ve only really known about him from movies, music and TV shows. I have a lot of respect for him putting all of this (this meaning the weight gain/loss, history, personal stuff) out there for anyone to see. I don’t think I could do that. 

I really enjoyed this series.
