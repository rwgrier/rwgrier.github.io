I have a video game backlog that is about a mile long. So many new games to play, so what do I do? I play a game that came out in 1992, 30 years ago.

Last week, I finished playing through [The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda%3A_A_Link_to_the_Past) for about the 40th time. Not really, but I have played through the game a number of times. 

I first played The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past in 1992. I fell in love with it immediately. I still play through the game from time to time. 

Most recently, I’ve played through this on my [Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/switch/) through [Nintendo Switch Online](https://www.nintendo.com/switch/online-service/), which is an online service that allows me to play old games like this. 

I think this game came out at the right time for me growing up. I had played Zelda games before and after this one. But this one stuck with me. 

I don’t profess to be amazing at the game. I’m not. I die a lot. It’s more about the experience of the game. The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past fits like a glove. I’m able to pick up the game and feel like I’m a teenager again. It’s great.

I’m conflicted on what I should play next. So many games. Too many games. Maybe I’ll play a new game. Or maybe I’ll play [The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-between-worlds-3ds/) on the Nintendo 3DS which is the spiritual successor to The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. 

We'll see...
