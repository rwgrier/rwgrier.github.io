I shipped the first version of [Beer Style Guidelines](https://www.beerstyleguidelines.app) on Jun 26, 2015. 

I've been supporting the app in an on and off fashion since then. There was a two-year hiatus when I didn't ship any updates to the app. That's over seven years of updates and support on an app I've never made a dime on. 

I think it's had a pretty good run. 

I want to work on other things. I've had a handful of other ideas that I've put on hold because I wanted to stick with Beer Style Guidelines. I'm not sure I want to do that anymore. 

I don't homebrew beer anymore. I haven't in years. Life just got in the way and it got hard to carve out the time to make beer. 

I currently have two updates in the works. 

The first update will re-add all the style guides I’ve added to the app over the years. This will mean Beer Style Guidelines will have seven guides.

I should have this first update out in the next week. 

The second update is much larger. I would like to add a macOS app. I’ve wanted to have a macOS app for Beer Style Guidelines for a while. I’m going to add a Mac Catalyst version of the app and get that working nicely.

For now, I think I’m going to see if I can get the macOS update out sometime this Summer. That will likely be the last major update to the app. 

I’m not sure if I’ll continue to add new guides each year. I think that will depend how I feel about the app when the new guides come out. 

I’ve started looking at my pile of app ideas that I put on hold. I’m thinking of trying out something small. No details yet, but I’m excited to work on something new.
