I recently finished the final novel in The Expanse series by James S. A. Corey. This series was recommended to me by my friend [Andy Obusek](http://cleanswifter.com). 

This series started slow for me. I can’t put my finger on why. It could have been the amount of world building the authors had to do. It could have been that I was going back and forth between other Sci-Fi novels and getting confused. It could have been I was in a weird place mentally with books at the time. It could have been anything. The result was that the first two or three books were slow reads for me. 

I finished the first book in September 2019. I didn’t finish the second book until June 2020 and the third book until February 2021. 

I almost gave up this journey, but Andy kept insisting that I continued on. I’m glad I did. 

Things picked up for me around book five or six. So much in fact, that I finished the last four books this year (and it’s April). I couldn't put the last few novels down and flew through them. 

I’ve recommended this series to several friends. One of them ended up (basically) reading the last few books with me. We would read them and talk about them via text. 

I did not read any of the novellas that occur outside the novels. I may read those next. 

There is also The Expanse TV series. I’ve heard it’s excellent. I haven’t started watching that yet. I didn’t want to get into a place where I was ahead of the novels. Now I don’t need to worry about it. 

If you're into Sci-Fi, check out The Expanse series. There are nine novels. This can seem daunting, but the journey is worth it.
