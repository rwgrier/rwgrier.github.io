I've recently upgraded my laptop. 

Previously, I was running a [2017 13" (Intel) Apple MacBook Pro](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP755?locale=en_US). It was good in most situations. However, the battery has started to suffer. I would get about an hour of (side-project) development time before the battery was at about 10%. 

I've upgraded to a [2021 14" (Apple Silicon) Apple MacBook Pro](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP854?locale=en_US) (M1 Pro). This machine is wonderful. It's a night and day difference from my old Intel machine. 

The battery life alone has been worth the upgrade. Instead of an hour of development time at night, I will be on it for a few hours and have 90% of the battery left. 

I made some upgrades to the base model. I went with a 1TB SSD and 32GBs of memory. I think these upgrades will help future-proof the machine. 

This new MacBook Pro has a notch at the top, but I stopped noticing it after about two days of usage. 

I am so happy to have [MagSafe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MagSafe#MagSafe_3) back. MagSafe has saved my butt once or twice in the past. 

I am just as happy to have the [Touch Bar](https://www.imore.com/touch-bar) gone. I didn't actively hate it, I just tried to pretend it didn't exist. It always felt incredibly clunky to me. 

I ordered this machine in mid-May. It arrived in late July. It took so long to be built and delivered that I started wondering if I should cancel the MacBook Pro order and buy a MacBook Air M2. The Midnight [MacBook Air M2](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air-m2/) is beautiful. However, after reading some reviews, I decided to stick with the MacBook Pro M1 (Pro). 

The new laptop will be used primarily for development. I do most of my casual computing on an iPad. But I save the real development work for my laptop. I wish that I could use my iPad for development, but I understand why I can't. 

When I [got my previous laptop](/2017/11/21/macbook-pro/), I said I wasn't sure if I would wait seven years for the next upgrade. I didn't. Instead of seven years, I only waited about five years. 

I am really happy that I upgraded to a new laptop.
