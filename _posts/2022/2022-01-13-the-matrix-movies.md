Over the Christmas break I rewatched the original [The Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix) trilogy. I haven’t seen these movies in a few years. I watched them in preparation to watch [The Matrix Resurrections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_Resurrections) on [HBO Max](https://www.hbomax.com) earlier this week. 

I think the first Matrix movie was revolutionary. At least in my eyes. I think it came out as the right time in my life. It was such a good movie. For a long time after watching it, I would think about the movie a lot. Even rewatching the original, I am reminded of how much I liked it. 

For a little while after the original movie, I wished they would make a sequel. And then they did. The two sequels they made were not good. 

[The Matrix Reloaded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_Reloaded) and [The Matrix Revolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_Revolutions) weren’t like the Star Wars prequels. The Star Wars sequels weren’t great, but had their place. The Matrix sequels were just bad and I managed to block them from my memory. When I rewatched them last month, I had completely forgotten what happened. 

Whenever I think of The Matrix sequels, I think of [this XKCD Comic](https://xkcd.com/566/) (Matrix Revisited). The comic came out 10 years after the release of the original (and after the sequels), but still wished for sequels. 

I watched The Matrix Resurrections over a few days earlier this week (it takes me a while to watch movies). I really enjoyed it. It was enough nostalgia without relying too much on the original movie. I don’t think it was as good as the first one, but _way_ better then the second two movies. 

If you’ve watched the original trilogy and gave up on them, try The Matrix Resurrections. It’s good. This is another movie I want to watch again.
