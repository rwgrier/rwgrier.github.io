I’ve consumed quite a bit of content in 2021. Here are some of my favorites. Not all of these were released in 2021, but it’s when I enjoyed them. So I’m going to count them. And since I’m making up the rules here, I’ll allow it. 

## Books
In 2021, I read [43 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/25840660). I liked most of the books that I’ve read. I couldn’t put down either of the following books. 

### Favorite
My favorite book that I read this year was [Hail Mary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54493401-project-hail-mary) by Andy Weir. I really like his books and this was no exception. It’s a great Sci-Fi novel. 

### Runner Up
It was hard to chose a runner up. It was really close between any of The Expanse novels that I’ve read. But I think my runner up is [Press Reset](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55277893-press-reset) by Jason Schreier. It’s a great look into the video game industry when things don’t quite go as planned. 

## Movies
I don’t watch as many movies as I used to. I really enjoy watching movies, but I am alone on this in my house. So I try to sneak movies in here and there. Sometimes it’ll take me a week to watch a movie. I was able to talk some family members into watching these two movies though. 

### Favorite
[Dune](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/dune/id1585877256) was such a good movie. I only watched it once, but can’t wait to watch it again. The movie also has an [amazing soundtrack](https://music.apple.com/us/album/dune-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/1583651332), which I have listened to multiple times (including [The Dune Sketchbook](https://music.apple.com/us/album/the-dune-sketchbook-music-from-the-soundtrack/1580377303)). 

### Runner up
[No Time to Die](https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/no-time-to-die/id1589483727) is a great ending to the Daniel Craig Bond movies. The Daniel Craig Bond movies are the only Bond movies I’ve seen, but I’ve enjoyed all of them. This one was no different. 

## TV Shows
We watch more TV Shows than movies. But we end up watching older shows like The Office, Seinfeld, Friends, etc.

### Favorite
[Wandavision](https://disneyplus.com/series/wandavision/4SrN28ZjDLwH?sharesource=iOS) was a bit of a slow start. Once things got going, they didn’t slow down until the end.   I spent a lot of time reading the [Wandavision subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/WANDAVISION/) theorizing about what might happen next. 

### Runner up
[Ted Lasso](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/ted-lasso/umc.cmc.vtoh0mn0xn7t3c643xqonfzy) (Season 2) was a family favorite. I think we watched the entire season over a weekend. We’re all looking froward to season 3. 

## Video Games
Along with movies, I don’t play as many video games as I used to. And I’ve actually gotten pretty bad at them. But I did play a few video games this past year.

### Favorite
I both played and finished [Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order](https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/jedi-fallen-order). I have a thing for Star Wars content. This was probably the best Star Wars game I’ve played in a while. I hope they make a sequel to this game. I had a lot of fun playing though it. 

### Runner up
[Metroid Dread](https://metroid.nintendo.com). I have a special love/hate relationship with this game. It’s an amazing game. But I am terrible at it. I died hundreds of times. I persisted and made it to the end boss. 

I really enjoyed how Metroid Dread made me better at the game the more I tried (and died). I never finished the game though. I got to the final boss, got frustrated, took some time off and have probably forgotten everything I’ve learned while playing. 

## 2022
2022 is just hours away. I have a backlog of content. I hope to make another list like this next year.
