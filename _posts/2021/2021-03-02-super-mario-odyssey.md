This past weekend, I finished playing through [Super Mario Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Odyssey) on the [Nintendo Switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch). The game flew by for me. I hadn’t even realized I was near the end of the story, and there I was. 

There isn’t a lot to the plot. If you’ve played any other Super Mario games, this one has a very similar plot. Princess Peach was kidnapped by Bowser and it’s up to you to rescue her. It’s not very imaginative. But playing the game is a lot of fun.

Once you’ve finished the game, you can go back to all of the worlds and attempt to collect Power Moons. I did not collect every Power Moon in the game. I’m not sure if I’ll even go back and play through more. I had just enough fun playing through the main storyline. It was the perfect amount for me. 

It was a very fun game. It also wasn’t too difficult to get through the main storyline. I’d recommend this for anyone who enjoys 3D Super Mario games. 

I also have [Super Mario Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Galaxy) on the Nintendo Switch. I never played through this when it was out on the [Wii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii). I’m not sure if I want to play through that or look for something else to play.
