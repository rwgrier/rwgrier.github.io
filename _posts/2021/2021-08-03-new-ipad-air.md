I recently bought a [2020 iPad Air](https://www.apple.com/ipad-air/). This new iPad Air is an upgraded from my [(2016) iPad Pro 9.7”](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP739?locale=en_US). That old iPad Pro was probably my favorite iOS device. I used it all the time. In the last few months, the iPad Pro was starting to slow down a bit. It was time for an upgrade. 

I love the design of the this iPad Air. I think it looks great. It’s a much ‘flatter’ design compared to my old iPad Pro. 

The home button is also gone, which means the bezel around the screen is smaller. There’s still a Touch ID sensor, but it’s now on the power button. I would probably prefer the Face ID capabilities of the new iPad Pros.

## Why didn’t I get a new iPad Pro? 
I use iPads a lot. I use them for most of my personal computing. The only thing I don’t use them for is writing code. Xcode is not on the iPad (yet?), so I still need to use my Mac writing code. The new iPad Pros were a bit outside of my price range and I’m not sure if I would need or use all of the features on the [iPad Pro](https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/). I may regret all of this if/when Apple announces iOS development on the iPad Pros. 

In the future I may go back to an iPad Pro. That decision will be for “future Ryan.” That new screen on the iPad Pro 12.9” looks amazing. But for now I am really happy with my choice. 

## Accessories 

Along with the iPad Air, I also bought the [Magic Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/ipad-keyboards/) and [Apple Pencil](https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/). 

The price of the Magic Keyboard was a bit steep, but I’ve been very happy with it so far. I’m using the Magic Keyboard to write this blog post. I think an external keyboard of some sort is a necessity for the larger iPads. 

I’m still torn on the Apple Pencil. I had one with my old iPad and rarely used it. I think it will end up being something I use from time to time. I’m not sure it’s a necessity for me.  
 
## Moving Forward

I’ve been thinking with ways to use my iPad as a development machine. I haven’t figured it out yet.

I have [Screens](https://edovia.com/en/screens-ios/) installed and am using that as a [VNC client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing) to my Mac. I’ve been trying that so that I can use Xcode. Yeah, I know that I could just use my MacBook Pro. I’ve been thinking of getting an [M1 Mac Mini](https://www.apple.com/mac-mini/) and using my iPad when I am not in my office. 

I’ve tried a handful of editors for web development and just haven’t found one that I like yet. I would like it to do both text editing and [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) management, but haven’t been happy with any of the options. 

I’m going to keep looking. I *really* want to make it work, I just don’t know if I can. Yet. 

So far I am really happy with the new iPad Air.
