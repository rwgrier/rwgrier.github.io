I’ve changed employers. 

I’ve been working for Warner Bros. Digital Labs (which used to be DramaFever) essentially for 5 years. I took a small break there a few years ago, but almost immediately came back.

I’ve worked on a variety of projects over the last few years which have included DramaFever, [Boomerang](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boomerang-cartoons-movies/id1199519834) and [DC Universe](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dc-universe-infinite/id1329018000). The later two have both been featured on the app stores multiple times. These have all been on iOS and tvOS. I’ve been very proud of the work I’ve done. 

The work environment at WBLD was also great. I enjoyed everyone that I worked with. But now, it’s time for a change. 

I just started working for a new company. I’m now a Staff iOS Engineer for [Slice](https://slicelife.com). I started last Monday and I’m pretty excited about it. 

This is going to present a new set of challenges for me. I’m moving away from entertainment based apps to an app that provides food to people. I hope to learn a lot while in my new role. 

This is going to be exciting.
