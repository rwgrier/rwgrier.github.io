I found this article the other day. [RUNDISNEY STAR WARS MEDALS ARE MOST IMPRESSIVE – EXCLUSIVE PREVIEW!](http://www.starwars.com/news/rundisney-star-wars-medals-are-most-impressive-exclusive-preview). I didn’t know these existed. These make me wish I was still running a lot. I want all of the medals. They would look great alongside my other 10k, half-marathon and marathon medals.

Maybe I’ll get back into running at some point. If I do, I’ll also have to talk the family into coming with me to Disney.
