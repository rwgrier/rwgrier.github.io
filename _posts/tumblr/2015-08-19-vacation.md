I recently got back from vacation. Well, actually two vacations. This year was an odd one. We took two vacations within a 3-week timespan.

Our first vacation was to the Outer Banks in North Carolina. We went away with my family. This was a first for us, normally we travel with Lori’s family. We had a great time. We spent time on the beach, kayaking, by the pool and just relaxing.

Our second vacation was to Wildwood, NJ. My sister-in-law has a house there. We spent that week with my in-laws. That was also a great time. We spent three days crabbing. We also took the ferry to Lewes, DE and shopped in the outlets there. We even had a little bit of time to visit [Dogfish Head Brewery](https://www.dogfish.com) in Milton, DE.

Overall we had a great time. The only bummer now is that it’s back to normal lives. That and planning on our next vacation.
