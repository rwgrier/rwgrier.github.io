I’m still working on MyCntdwn 4. I promise. Really. I’ve got a lot of tasks that I am slowly working through. I’m in the middle of making it a proper Universal app. I’m probably about 60% through this process. Some issues have come up while working on this, but I’ve been able to manage so far.

My original plan ([way back when](/2014/03/18/seesaw/)) was to have an update out by the end of April. Obviously that didn’t happen. My updated goal is to have an update ready for the iOS 8 launch. It’s my goal, but the chances of it actually happening are pretty slim. There’s a lot of work to do yet.

My plan for MyCntdwn 4 is still way up in the air. The initial version will roll MyCntdwn, MyCntdwn HD and MyCntup into a single app. It will have updated themes. Anything outside of that is up in the air.

Do I add syncing for the initial release? Probably not, I want to get it out to users.

Should this be a free upgrade? I’m not sure. I hope that supporting the app with free updates since 2008 has been long enough. I’m putting a lot of time and energy into this, I’d like to get something back.

Should I offer some sort of In-App purchase? Meh. I dunno. It has to be done right, or else it will be awful.

Do I forget iOS 7 and just start adding iOS 8 features? Maybe, but that will take more time.

Of course, all of this is subject to change.
