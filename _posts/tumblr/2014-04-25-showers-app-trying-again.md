I’m giving Showers another shot.

I’ve refined the user interface. Previously, the settings were located in the iOS settings section. I’ve moved those into the app. I’ve also added a setting to chose your favorite background, or randomize them.

On [the suggestion](https://twitter.com/mclazarus/status/455445637321203713) of a [friend](https://twitter.com/mclazarus), I’ve added a sleep timer to the app. It wasn’t originally in the plan for this version, but I took the time to add it.

I’ve also added more dynamic volume levels to the thunder volumes. Instead of being played at 100% volume all of the time, the volume is more dynamic. It should give a better feeling of listening to a real thunderstorm.

The app is still simple. It does a few things, and it does them well. I hope that this is enough to get through the Apple Approval Process.
