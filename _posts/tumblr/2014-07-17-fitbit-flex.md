I bought a [Fitbit Flex](https://www.fitbit.com/flex2) about a week ago. I really like it. My only complaint is that I keep looking at my wrist expecting to see a time.

I’ve been averaging about 11k steps a day. Before the Fitbit Flex, I was tracking steps with [Pedometer++](http://pedometerplusplus.com) and averaging about 8k steps. I don’t think I’m doing anything different, it’s just the Fitbit is always on me. I’d often leave my phone on a table somewhere and forget to take it with me.

The social aspect of Fitbit is nice too. Some friendly competition between friends never hurt anyone. I’m not really taking any more steps as a result of my Fitbit, but some of my friends are. I wonder how long this little trend will last.
