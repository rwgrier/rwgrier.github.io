[Hearthstone](https://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/) is an awesome game and I am terrible at it.

It’s a (free) card-based game with [World of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/) characters/cards. I’ve never been much of a card game player, but this game has its hooks in me.

I’ve been laid up a bit for the last few weeks and have been playing quite a bit of it. I have been playing it on both the [iPhone and iPad](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hearthstone/id625257520?mt=8). These apps are perfect for playing the game.

I love playing as both a Mage and Hunter. I’m not great at the other character classes. Often, I’ll play just enough ranked online matches to get my monthly card back. Lately I’ve also been playing through the solo adventures. They are fun and challenging (for me anyway).

I’m going to stick with it. It’s a fun game. Who knows, maybe I’ll eventually get better.
