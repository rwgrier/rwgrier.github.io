This past weekend, I finished the Hearthsone adventure One Night in Karazhan on heroic difficulty. Honestly, it wasn’t that tough. The adventure itself was a pretty easy one.

I waited until all of the adventure wings were released before even starting. And once I started, I had trouble with the first battle… on Normal. This happens to me every time. It takes me a bit to get started. Once I got back into the swing of adventuring, it was pretty easy to go through the adventure.

I did quite a bit of netdecking for this adventure. I probably didn’t have to, but I did. Oh well. Here are a list of decks that I used to complete One Night in Karazhan on heroic difficulty.

The hardest battle for me was the chess match. I spent a few days, a handful of matches a night, trying to win. It finally clicked for me and I won pretty decisively.

I really enjoy these adventures. The adventures always introduce some unique twists to the game. The chess match in this adventure was very unique. I’ve also always been more of a single-player gamer. The adventures are perfect for someone like me.

I’m already looking forward to the next adventure.
