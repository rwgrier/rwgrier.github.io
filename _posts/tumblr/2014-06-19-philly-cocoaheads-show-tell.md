I presented at last week’s [Philly CocoaHeads](http://phillycocoa.org) meet up. Presented is a bit strong. I showed off a few things to those in attendance. I was in front of the group for about 10 minutes.

I showed off Showers first. I showed it off for some self promotion and to get some feedback on some UI elements. The group had a lot of questions for me and some really nice feedback. I’m going to try including some of this feedback in an upcoming update.

I also showed how we do builds at work. We have a fairly complex setup (multiple environments and App Store accounts). I walked through some of what we need to do. I also showed off the Rakefile that we use (which was inspired by this [Gist](https://gist.github.com/rudyjahchan/1017153)).

This was my first presentation of any kind at our Philly CocoaHeads meet up. I’m not much of a presenter, but I’m happy with how it turned out. I hope to show off more stuff in the future.
