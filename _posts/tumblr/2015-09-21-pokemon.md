Prior to this Summer, I’ve played a handful of Pokemon games, but I never finished any. This Summer I’ve finished 4 of them. [Pokemon X](http://www.pokemonxy.com/en-us/root/), [Pokemon Alpha Sapphire](http://www.pokemonrubysapphire.com/en-us/), [Pokemon White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokémon_Black_and_White) and Pokemon Omega Ruby in that order.

Why did I do that to myself? I’m not sure. It gave me something to play with my youngest while we had some downtime or were on vacation. We’d compare progress and have battles against each other.

Now I’m debating if I want to take a break from it, or go all in and try to catch as many of the Pokemon that I can. But that may prove that I’ve got some issues. I’m still not sure.
