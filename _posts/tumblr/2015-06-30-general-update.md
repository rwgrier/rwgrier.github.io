It’s been a long time since I’ve posted anything here. I’m sorry about that.

My homebrew has been coming along. Last month, I entered 3 beers into the annual [BUZZ Homebrew Club](https://sites.google.com/site/buzzhomebrewclub/) [BUZZ Off competition](https://sites.google.com/site/buzzhomebrewclub/buzzoff). None of them won, but I got some valuable feedback from the judges. It was also good to know that the one I liked the best, did the best.

I have been updating my iOS app Showers. In my most recent update, Showers is now free. So go get it.

I’ve also released a brand new app called Beer Styles. That’s a free app with beer style guidelines. The first guidelines that are included are the [2015 BJCP Guidelines](https://www.bjcp.org/). More on this in a later post.

I’m also slowly working on an update for MyCntdwn. The current plan is to have this support iOS 9 when that is released later this year. I’ve been making good progress, but I still have a lot that I want to do.

This was just a brief update. I plan on posting more about each of these shortly. Hopefully.
