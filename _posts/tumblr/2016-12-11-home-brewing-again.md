It’s been over a year since I last made a homebrew beer. The last batch I brewed was last October.

I’ve had some issues that prevented me from brewing any, but that story is for another time. I was technically able to brew again over the Summer. I almost did, but controlling the temperature during the Summertime can be tricky and I didn’t want to have to deal with that. So, instead, I decided to wait until temperature control was easier.  I wanted to make this beer in October, but we had too many other priorities, until now.

Today, I am making a [Galaxy Single Hop IPA](https://brooklynbrewshop.com/collections/beer-making-kits/products/galaxy-single-hop-ipa-beer-making-kit). It’s a 1-gallon kit that I got from [Brooklyn Brew Shop](https://brooklynbrewshop.com). I got this kit over a year ago. I hope it turns out nicely. They say the kits can sit for a year and still be good. We’re going to test that out today.

I’m pretty nervous about this batch. The kit is a little past it’s prime. I also haven’t made any in such a long time. I’m expecting to be disappointed in this batch. But that’s OK. I’ll get back into the swing and start making some really good beer again.

I’ll know how this turned out in about four weeks. Wish me luck.
