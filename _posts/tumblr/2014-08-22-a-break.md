In an ([earlier post](/2014/03/18/seesaw/)) I had mentioned that I had been working in a bit of a manic phase on my personal apps. I’m afraid that’s come to an end and I’ve moved into the depression phase where I don’t work on any of my personal apps.

I need a break. I’ve been doing a lot of work since March and want to take some time off from it. I had hoped to get in a bit more work before I stopped working, but I didn’t quite make it. I’m not sure how long this phase will last, I hope it’s not too long.
