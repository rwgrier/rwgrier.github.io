Last year I posted a few times that I was contemplating an update to [MyCntdwn](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mycntdwn/id293970065?mt=8). It’s been almost two years since I released v 3.0. I had worked on it for a few months last year, but stopped in mid-August. I think I was just burned out a bit.

Well, I’m back at it. I have been working on the update since mid-March. I finally have an idea of what exactly will be in v 4.0. I think I’m actually about 90% of the way there.

One problem I have is that I keep getting lost in the weeds. I keep finding things to tweak or classes to convert to Swift. I really need to stop and get ready to ship what I have.

I also just came across another issue. I have been working on a complete redesign. I showed it to my wife the other night. She’s not a fan… Maybe I’ll write more about that in another post.

Bah! There’s so much to do.
