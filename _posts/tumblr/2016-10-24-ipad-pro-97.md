I’ve been waiting for a new laptop for what feels like forever. I really thought Apple would announce the new MacBook Pros at [WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/), but that didn’t happen. Now it sounds like they’ll be doing so later this week.

I still don’t have a personal laptop. I can (and do) write code on the MacBook Pro I gave to my wife late last year. But my wife uses that laptop, a lot. I also have a company issued laptop. But I don’t want to use the company laptop for personal items.

Over the Summer, I decided to buy an [iPad Pro](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-pro). The baby one. The 9.7" one. With it, I also bought the [Smart Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/smart-keyboard/) and [Apple Pencil](https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/). I bought the 128 GB Gold model. I normally buy the black version of every iOS device, but this time I wanted something different. I almost went Rose Gold, but that’s a bit too different.

I have been really happy with the iPad Pro. I’ve been able to do everything I would want to do on a laptop except for write code. I’ve even written the last few posts on the iPad Pro (using [Byword](https://bywordapp.com)). The iPad Pro is the perfect, sit on the couch and surf the Internet while watching TV, device. I use it almost every night as that kind of device.

However, writing iOS code is a huge part of who I am and what I do. I am an iOS Developer. Without being able to write code for and on iOS, I am lost. I hope that one day, they take the Swift app and expand on it so we can write production-level code on the iPad.

Something else I don’t do much on the iPad Pro is game on it. I can play some games, but not everything. In fact, I have a gaming PC (that I built a few years ago) that’s dedicated to gaming. I do play some games on the iPad Pro, but games like World of [Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/), [GuildWars 2](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/), [Civilization V](http://www.civilization5.com) (I haven’t bought VI yet), etc need to be played on a PC. Even if I had a nice Mac, games don’t have the same support that they do on PCs.

The iPad has been good for me. So good in fact, that I think I’ll wait on a new Mac. But let’s see what Apple announces first.
