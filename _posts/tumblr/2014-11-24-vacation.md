We just got back from a nice long vacation. Ten of us went to [Universal Studios Florida](https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/theme-parks/universal-studios-florida/index.html) and [Universal’s Islands of Adventure](https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us/theme-parks/islands-of-adventure/index.html) for 3 days, a 5 day [Disney Cruise](https://disneycruise.disney.go.com/ships/dream/) (a double dip) and a day in [Busch Gardens Tampa](https://buschgardens.com/tampa/) and [SeaWorld](https://seaworld.com/orlando/). It was a marathon of a trip, but we all had a great time.

All of the parks and the cruise ship were decorated for Christmas. It was a really nice experience.

We’ve already started talking about another Disney Cruise.
