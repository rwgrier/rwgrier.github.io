I haven’t been working on any of my side projects lately ([MyCntdwn](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mycntdwn/id293970065?mt=8), [Showers](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/showers-white-noise-generator/id842747465?mt=8) or [Beer Style Guidelines](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/beer-style-guidelines/id998139111?mt=8)). My wife’s laptop died and I gave her mine. That means I don’t have a computer that is my own right now. I have my work computer, but I won’t use that for side projects. Whenever I jump onto that computer to do something quick, I end up checking email, Slack and following up on a number of things.

I’m pretty bummed about this. My side projects give me a chance to work on something different outside of work. It also gives me a chance to learn new technologies and experiment with things.

I know, I know. Just buy a new computer. Well, the one I want to get is not cheap and we don’t have the extra money right now. Maybe sometime soon.
