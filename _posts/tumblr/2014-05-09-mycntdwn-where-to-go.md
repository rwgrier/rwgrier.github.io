I’ve been contemplating a rather large update to MyCntdwn. I want to consolidate MyCntup and MyCntdown HD into MyCntdwn. I also want to add some syncing/backup solution to the app. The problem is, I just don’t know if it is worth it.

I released MyCntdwn in October 2008, a few months after the store App Store launched. It has done well enough for me that I updated it for iOS 7 last year. I just don’t know if it is worth it to continue updating it.

I want to continue supporting the app, MyCntdwn has been my “baby” project since I started learning Obj-c and iOS. Every time I think about playing with some new technology, I think about how to incorporate the technology into MyCntdwn.

Thoughts? Should I continue making updates? Should I concentrate on new and interesting apps? Let me know.
