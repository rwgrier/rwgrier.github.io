Showers is my new app.

It’s a very simple app. It’s a rain / thunderstorm white noise generator. It plays rain on a loop with dynamic thunder. You can adjust the amount of thunder in the settings or turn it off completely.

I submitted version 1.0 to Apple for review last night. It usually takes Apple about a week to approve assuming there are no issues with the app.

I built this app for myself. I hope you enjoy it too. It’s coming soon on the Apple App Store.
