I recently released a new app called [Beer Styles: BJCP 2015](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/beer-style-guidelines/id998139111?mt=8). It’s an iOS Beer Style Guide for homebrewers and hmebrew beer judges. Some of the features include: searchable database and style favorites.

The first version of the app included the [2015 BJCP Style Guidelines](https://www.bjcp.org/). I hope to include other style guides in the future, even if it’s only the 2008 BJCP Style Guidelines.

The base app is free. The base app will always be free. I have some thoughts about adding in-app purchases for things like printing styles and synchronizing your favorites between devices. But these aren’t in the immediate future.

Originally, I had included iAds in the app, but decided to remove them at the last minute. I just didn’t like it.

The app is written entirely in Swift. It started out as a Swift-only project and stayed that way through the end.

I have plans for some of the iOS 9 features announced at [Apple’s WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/). I hope to incorporate those shortly and have a nice update out in time for the iOS 9 release.
