Well, this is embarrassing. Showers was to be my newest app. It has been rejected by Apple for being too simple. I tried the appeal process and the app is still rejected.

Apple doesn’t believe that the app has enough features to keep a user engaged. So, I’ll take a step back and reassess. I thought the features listed in the app were perfect. I’m not typically a fan of adding features just for the sake of adding features. This is going to annoy me.

The app appeal process was simple even if the results were unsatisfying.

As of right now, the app is still coming, just not soon.
