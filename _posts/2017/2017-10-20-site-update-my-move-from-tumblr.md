It’s been a while since I’ve posted here. I’m sorry about that. I had thought I was going to start getting into a nice cadence for posting content. 

Over the past few years, I’ve been using [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com) as my main blogging platform. I used to really like using Tumblr. Since I started posting on Tumblr a few years ago, not much has changed with the service. The dashboard interface and editor are frustrating to use. I usually spend about 5 minutes searching the site for a feature I want to use. 

In the past few years, I’ve also started using [Medium](https://medium.com). I really like their interface for almost everything. It’s not perfect, but it’s _so_ much better than trying to use Tumblr. Medium also brings me a lot of exposure to my posts that I wouldn’t receive otherwise. I’m also not sure Medium is the appropriate place to post more personal posts like this one. 

I had been cross-posting my more technical posts to my personal blog and my Medium site. I think for now I’ll continue to do that. 

## My Alternative to Tumblr

I’ve been tinkering with several alternatives using Tumblr for the last few weeks. I’ve finally come to the following approach. 

I’ve set up a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/rwgrier/rwgrier.github.io) and I am using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host the pages. It’s an open repository. And I did that on purpose. I don’t really care if you take a look at how I have things set up. Feel free.

GitHub Pages allows you to use custom domains. So I just have my domain ([ryan.grier.co](https://ryan.grier.co)) pointing to my GitHub Pages site. 

The site is using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is supported by GitHub Pages. The theme I’m using is a modified [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) theme. I think this theme the best of the pre-made ones I’ve found, but it’s a little outdated and needed some updates. 

Using Jekyll allows me to test the website locally before committing my changes to GitHub and (automatically) deploying them to the site. I can also write all of my blog posts (and pages) in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (using [Ulysses](https://ulyssesapp.com/)). 

This setup and process aren’t exactly perfect yet, but I’m working on it.  

## Added SSL to the Site

One thing I’ve been meaning to do for a while now is to add SSL (HTTPS) to the site. When I originally asked Tumblr Support, they didn’t support SSL with custom domains. They may now, I haven’t looked. 

GitHub Pages doesn’t support this out of the box. Instead, you can use [Cloudflair](https://www.cloudflare.com) to accomplish this. It’s exactly what I did. They have a [blog post](https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/) on how to set this up. They make it super easy to set up and use. 

## Conclusion 

Prior to finding GitHub Pages, I had already started converting my site to use Jekyll. I was going to use that _somewhere_ to host the site. I had imported all of my old Tumblr posts to the new format. Since I had the conversion work taken care of, setting up the GitHub repo and GitHub Pages took about 30  minutes to get up and working. 

I am very happy with how this setup is working so far. My opinion may change as I work out the kinks in my posting process. 

I hope that this change will get me back to regularly posting content here (and on Medium). I guess only time will tell.
